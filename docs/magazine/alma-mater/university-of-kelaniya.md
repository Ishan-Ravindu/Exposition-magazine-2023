# University of Kelaniya

The University of Kelaniya is one of the premier
state universities established in Sri Lanka.
Located in Kelaniya, just outside of Colombo, it
is home to two institutes, twenty seven centers,
seven faculties and fifty-five departments.

The University of Kelaniya originates from the
historic Vidyalankara Pirivena, founded in 1875 by
the Venerable Ratmalane Sri Dharmaloka Thero as
a center of learning for Buddhist monks. With the
establishment of modern universities in Sri Lanka, in
1978 the Vidyalankara Pirivena ultimately became
the University of Kelaniya. The university has the
vision “To become a center of excellence in creation
and dissemination of knowledge for sustainable
development” and works towards its mission which
is “To nurture intellectual citizens who can contribute
to national development, through creativity and
innovation”. It has several departments not found
generally in the Sri Lankan University system.

The university provides students with the finest
facilities in all aspects; the Academic Division,
Examination Division, Medical Center, Library,
Student Welfare Division, Career Guidance Unit,
Physical Education and Research Council are
significant among them. It has unique fields
of study that has great potential to attract
both local and international students. It has
the highest number of international students,
the number exceeding 500 and offers over 100 scholarship
opportunities annually.
