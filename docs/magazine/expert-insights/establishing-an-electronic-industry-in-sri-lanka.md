Integrated Circuit (IC) has
become a hot topic in international
media because, at present, the
world is experiencing a severe
shortage of ICs. This has adversely
affected the production capacity of
many high-tech manufacturers since
the functioning of each and every
high-tech product depends on the
processing power of various types
of ICs.

At the same time, using IC as a
weapon, the United States of America
(the USA) is in a technology cold war
with China. At present, the US is
the leader in the global IC industry.
There are two main components in
the global IC value chain, namely, IC
design and IC manufacturing. The
US is the leader in IC design. Taiwan,
which is an ally of the US, is the leader
in IC manufacturing. Furthermore,
most of the sub-components of the
global IC value chain are positioned
on the shores of allies of the US (e.g.
roughly 70 percent of etching gas
and 90 percent of photoresists for
the world market are produced by
Japanese companies).

In 2015, China started its Made
in China 2025 (MIC2025) initiative
to become the world leader in 10
industries (please see Figure 1). Out
of the 10 industries, nine depend on
the processing power of ICs. Apart
from that, in China, there are many
other industries that depend on
the processing power of ICs. China
imported ICs worth USD 320 billion
in 2018.

The US considers MIC 2025
a threat to its technological
dominance. Therefore, to block
MIC 2025, the US decided to use
IC as a weapon. In March 2020, the
US ordered the world’s largest IC
manufacturer, TSMC, to terminate
its supplies to Huawei Technologies,
China.
Furthermore,
the
US
requested that its IC firms move their
manufacturing plants out of China
(e.g. GlobalFoundries scrapped its
USD 4 billion investment and moved
out of China). China received this as
a killer blow to its MIC2025 initiative
and the survival of many other
tech industries. Beijing realized the
significance of developing its own
semiconductor industry. Therefore,
the government of China initiated a
project to become self-sufficient in
ICs. The aims of the new initiative are
to fulfill 70% of the IC requirements
of China by 2025, to become a
major exporter of ICs by 2025, and
to become a world leader in every
aspect of IC technology by 2030.
The Chinese Communist government
has pledged that they will pour a
massive USD 1.4 trillion into high-
tech industries until 2025, backing
companies such as chipmaker SMIC.

Following the path of the US,
China might also aim to position its
own IC value chain within its allies to
establish its geographical presence.
By observing the trends in the US
dominant value chain, it is possible
to assume that China might be willing
to position various medium and low-
end manufacturing operations of
the IC value chain, such as wafer
manufacturing, assembling, and
testing, outside of China.

Based on this background, the IC
shortage and the geo-political trends
created by the trade war between the
US and China have created a window
of opportunity for countries such as
Sri Lanka. When shifting from low-
end agriculture-based economies to
high-tech manufacturing economies,
countries such as Taiwan, South
Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, and
the Philippines have experienced
direct
government
intervention
to attract initial Foreign Direct
Investments (FDIs). For example,
Malaysia received its first high-tech
manufacturing facility from Intel
Inc. back in 1972 as a result of the
bilateral trade discussions between
the USA and Malaysia. Since then,
Intel Inc. has invested about USD 6.5
billion in the country over the past 48
years. More recently, the Vietnamese
government
invited
Samsung
Semiconductors to develop a USD
1 billion IC manufacturing plant in
Ho Chi Minh City through the South
Korean government.

Going by this trend, if Sri
Lanka is to establish a high-tech
industrial culture within the country
by capitalizing on the above-
mentioned window of opportunity,
the direct policy and diplomatic
involvement of the government are
a must. As discussed earlier, the
IC value chain consists of two main
components, namely, IC design
and IC manufacturing. Initially, Sri
Lanka should try to establish an
IC manufacturing operation in the
country. Sri Lanka could approach
the US, Chinese, and/or South Korean
governments for assistance. Based
on the socio-cultural situation in Sri
Lanka, it is ideal if the country can
attract investment for an IC assembly
and packaging plant. Ideally, this
should happen by the end of 2023.
Once the assembling and packaging
operation is up and running, the
government
should
focus
on
attracting IC wafer manufacturers
to set up IC foundries. However, the
establishment of a foundry is not as
easy as establishing an assembly
and packaging plant due to the
technological sophistication and
the requirement of higher volumes
of water and uninterrupted power.
At the same time, the government
should directly intervene to promote
Sri Lanka as a high-tech investment
destination for consumer electronics
companies. Sri Lanka is an ideal
investment destination for Chinese,
Taiwanese, South Korean, and
Japanese consumer electronics
companies. Ideally, the government
should focus on establishing
Sri Lanka’s first foundry and/or
consumer electronics manufacturing
facility by the end of 2028.

When considering the long-
term sustainability of a high-tech
industrial culture, focusing only
on the manufacturing aspect
of the industry is not sufficient.
Countries such as Malaysia and
Thailand are focusing mainly on the
manufacturing aspect.

Malaysia is already caught in
the middle-income trap, and it is
forecasted that Thailand will also
be caught in the middle-income
trap due to an overreliance on high-
tech manufacturing. When studying
countries such as Taiwan and
South Korea that have successfully
evaded the middle-income trap, it is
evident that any country that plans
to establish a sustainable high-tech
industrial culture should focus on
developing a human resource that can
contribute toward the advancement
of the global high-tech intellectual
value chain. Hence, we propose to
the Sri Lankan government to start
a degree program specializing in
IC design starting in 2023. The
government has the option of
establishing this degree in one of the
existing engineering faculties.

If the government is successful
in establishing an IC assembling and
packaging facility in Sri Lanka by
the end of 2023, the graduates who
will enroll in the degree program
could get themselves trained in the
IC assembly and packaging plant.
Once they graduate, they should
be provided with special training in
IC design at a research center that
is dedicated to high-tech research.
Ideally, this research center should
be backed by a global player in IC
design. The best option Sri Lanka
could think of is HiSilicon, the IC
designing arm of Huawei Inc.

Sri Lanka has been relying on
low-end exports such as foreign
remittance, tourism, agriculture
products, apparels, etc. to generate
export revenue. However, none of
these exports is capable of providing
the massive boost the country needs
if it is to become a USD 250 billion
economy by 2035 (as mentioned
in the president’s manifesto). At
present, Sri Lanka has a USD 88
billion economy. To become a USD
250 billion economy, the country
has to add USD 162 billion to its
economy. Ideally, exports should
account for a considerable portion
of that amount. However, if the
country continues to depend on the
above-mentioned exports, it will be
impossible to receive a considerable
contribution from them. This is
another reason why Sri Lanka should
try to capture a portion of the global
high-tech value chain.
