Data Scientist is a trending job in today’s world. Most
organizations are looking for data scientists to improve
and facilitate their decision-making to become more
competitive. This article is to understand the profile of
a data scientist, considering the roles, responsibilities,
and required skills for a data scientist.

## How Much Do You Earn?

Whatever is said or done, one crucial consideration
in any job is the salary you get from it. As you know,
it is challenging to identify salaries due to the many
complexities and differences. Therefore, let us look at
the salaries of data scientists in India for large-scale
companies.

As you can see from the above table, data scientists
earn a good salary across all companies. Now, let us
compare the salary of a data scientist with other jobs.

As you can see from the above two tables, data
scientists earn good salaries compared to other software-related jobs.

## Roles and Responsibilities

After looking at the salary benefits of Data scientists,
let us now look at the roles and responsibilities of a data
scientist. An ERP consultant works with the ERP while a
CRM expert works on the CRM. A software engineer is an
expert in one or a few software development frameworks.
However, a data scientist’s limit is the sky. He has to
work with all the data systems in the organization, which
consist of relational, NoSQL, and text files. He may
extend his data exploration skills to public data sources
outside the organization, such as Facebook, Twitter,
etc., and weather data. He may encounter different
databases such as relational databases, NoSQL, etc.
When a data scientist is presented with a wide variety of
data, he has the task of cleaning and transforming them.
Cleaning is not easy when working with different types
of databases. Cleaning is an art, so it requires some
domain experience as well as other techniques.

As a data scientist, his analysis will not be limited
to only existing data. He needs to derive data from
the existing data. For example, by looking at customer
purchases, a data scientist should be able to determine
the house members’ ages. Another example would
be, by analysing the television channels a customer
subscribed to, you could guess house members’ age.
These types of data engineering tasks are essential for
data scientists to make better decisions.

These types of data engineering tasks are essential for
data scientists to make better decisions.

While doing all these technical
aspects, a data scientist must
also understand the domain
knowledge, as these analytics
and solutions are useless if they
are not aligned with the domain.
Further, as a data scientist,
you are dealing with the data
of your customers. So it would
help if you implemented proper
mechanisms to protect data
using different security, auditing,
and encryption techniques. In
addition, a data scientist needs
to understand the analytical
system’s
performance
and
scalability aspects.

Typically, the matching technique is not limited to
a simple lookup. In most cases, the simple lookup will
not work, as these systems are developed to satisfy
isolated business processes. The data scientist may
have to derive new data to match data in multiple data
sources, or he may have to perform advanced matching
techniques such as fuzzy lookup or fuzzy grouping.

After all this work by data scientists, the data is ready
for analysis. As shown in the Gartner Continuum, there
are four types of analytics: descriptive, diagnostic,
predictive, and prescriptive.

After the data preparation, data modeling should be
done by the data scientists so that it can provide the
above-mentioned analysis for the organization. During
this phase, data scientists may have to build a data
warehouse, operational data sources, OLAP cubes, data
lakehouse, and data lakes as storage techniques.

Predictive analytics and prescriptive analytics are
the advanced analytics lacking in most organizations.
The data scientist plays a significant role in building
predictive and prescriptive analytics to enhance the
organization’s decision-making process. Data scientists
must implement Classification, Clustering, Association,
Regression, and Forecasting models in this decision-
making process. Solutionizing is one of the essential
parts of data analytics, as that is where an organization
can be victorious over its competitors.

After doing all of these activities, the data scientist
has to present his findings to different levels of users.
Therefore, visualization is another aspect that data
scientist has to perform.

## Required Skills

As we discussed the tasks of a data scientist, it is
now time to discuss what are the skills that are required
to become a data scientist. You might sense that by
looking at the data scientist’s task, you need various
skills to become a data scientist. The following figure
shows what technologies are needed to learn.

As you can see in figure 2, you need to know
various technologies and skills. Database technologies,
Statistics, Data mining, Machine learning, Process
mining, and Visualization are the leading technologies
that you need to learn. Further, looking at today’s trends,
it is essential to understand cloud technologies, as many
organizations are moving towards cloud computing. As
a data scientist, you may be required to consume data in the cloud as well as use the cloud for data analysis. Since
you are dealing with a large volume of data, it is essential
to understand distributed computing to process the
data efficiently. Apart from those technologies, as a data
scientist, you also need to understand non-functional
requirements, social science, and domain knowledge.
You might think learning all these technologies to
become a data scientist is impossible. You also might
consider a data scientist a mythical animal like a dragon.

As discussed in the fact box below, the dragon
combines seven body parts of different animals to
make him strong. Since it is not practical to employ a
data scientist with all of these skills, the most sensible
approach would be to have a team of scientists for
organizations to achieve their organizational goals.

## How to Prepare to Become a Data Scientist?

Even though most of you want to become a data
scientist, you might think twice as this is not a mature
profession. Though that is a valid argument, time might
not be on your side when the job matures, as there is
too much to learn according to figure 2. Therefore, start
learning today, focusing on a data scientist job. Be a
master in one area and have a basic understanding of
other relevant areas for a data scientist.
