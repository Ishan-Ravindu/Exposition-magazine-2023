Mimicking the intricacies of the
human brain has been one of the major
interests of the scientists over the last
few decades. With time, they have
succeeded in their goals to some extent,
thus creating artificial intelligence which
has the potential to perform higher
cerebral functions such as learning and
explicit memory. But the more challenging
task was to find a way to combine this
technology to a living human being, and
enhancing the ability of the human brain.
Recently, scientists have tackled this
challenge as well, thereby opening doors
to the utopia of advanced technology.

## What is special about neurons?

Brain is made of neurons. They also
carry signals between the brain and
effector organs such as muscles and
glands. Basically, they convert your
thoughts to action. Unlike other cells
of human body, neurons are difficult to
replicate artificially because they are
unique in more than one way. In order to
mimic a neuron, a microcircuit should
be able to integrate unrefined nervous
signals, and respond to them the same
way a biological neuron does. With careful
mapping of individual ion channels,
intracellular currents and membrane
voltages of different neurons found in
the human body, the dynamics of these
biological neurons were successfully
replicated using silicon micro circuits.
These are now commonly known as
‘solid-state neurons’ amongst scientific
community.

## World’s first artificial neuron

After years of research, a group of
scientists from the University of Bath,
United Kingdom has successfully created
the world’s very first artificial neuron.
Embedded in a silicon chip, this artificial
neuron has the potential to treat, and even
cure some chronic diseases that arise due
to degeneration of neural pathways, such
as Alzheimer’s disease. As the leading
scientist of this research group has stated;

Physics, University of Bath -

After the successful creation of
this promising technology, one of the
major problems scientists have faced
was finding a way to power these
micro-circuits. Providing a solution to
this matter, the inventors of the silicon
chip have cut down the required power
supply to one billionth of that needed for
a microprocessor. This not only makes it
ideal to be used in bio-electronic devices,
but also suitable to be directly implanted
into human bodies.

Therefore the microchip can be
surgically implanted in the brain, where it
can enhance signal transmission between
existing neurons, or act as replacement
for degenerating nerve cells.

## Sky is the limit

Although these solid-state neurons
are currently considered only for their
use in the medical field, there is so much
more potential to them beyond that. The
fictions we all grew up with can now
become a reality with this awe-inspiring
discovery. Artificial neurons have the
ability to tap into the biological network of
neurons within your body to enhance your
vision, hearing, memory and processing
speed of your brain. Because of the ability
of these implants to stimulate specific
areas of the brain precisely, they can be
developed to give mood boosts, exert the
effects of antidepressants, and a lot more.

You might be a little skeptical about
these high-end targets. But remember,
the basics of this technology is currently
in use and available in most parts of the
world. For example, there are cochlear
implants that can restore hearing in some
people with partial or complete hearing
impairments. There are only a few steps
further to go from there, to enhancing
it to pick up sound waves from a long
distance that is humanly impossible to
hear. Same goes for the retinal implants.
They are already able to restore vision in
people who are blind due to some genetic
conditions. So, undoubtedly the day
humans have built-in night vision is not
too far away.

Another fascinating possibility of this
new discovery is, power of controlling
computers and machines with nothing
but your mind. Just the way Professor
Xavier in X-men does, or maybe even
better than that!

## Brain power to operate computers

Attempts to use computers with the
sheer power of the brain dates back to
1960s. The procedure involved utilization
of an electronic device in the form of
a needle or a pin, tapping into the test
subject’s brain and transmitting neural
information, which is then decoded and
used to directly manipulate the computer,
rather than through physical interaction of
body parts and hardware.

One of the recent scientific
demonstrations of the same technique
has been done using the newfound
technology of wireless brain chip,
by Neuralink. Neuralink is one of the
divergent ventures of the well-known
business personnel, Elon Musk. Neuralink
demonstrated the successful outcome
of their research back in 2019, using a
monkey named Pager. The monkey is able
to play ‘Mind Pong’, which is their way of
introducing Pager’s ability to play the
video game ‘Pong’ using nothing but his
mind. No joy stick, no remote, no physical
contact whatsoever with the computer.

As mentioned above, with the
involvement of sharks of the field, the
commercial capacity of this discovery is
more than obvious. With all this attention,
there is one thing that never fails to
appear.

## Ethical issues

Just like any other high-tech
discovery, solid-state neurons also give
rise to a range of ethical issues. The very
first and the most alarming one being
the danger of highly invasive surgical
procedure of the implantation. Human
brain is a very formidable and extremely
complicated organ that we have yet to fully
understand. No matter how many animal
test subjects have become successful in
the procedure, there is always the risk of
long-term complications when it comes
to experimenting with humans.

Beyond that, if the procedure becomes
available to general public, the people
who have the wealth and power to get the
implant will be able to improve themselves
above normal human capabilities, while
the rest is left out. This will create super-
humans with unfair advantages over the
normal population. The resultant division
of the society will be inevitable.

Regardless of these minor drawbacks,
the discovery of the artificial neuron
has opened the path to the next step of
human evolution. With the correct control
and guidance in utilizing this technology,
human race will surely thrive for centuries
to come.
