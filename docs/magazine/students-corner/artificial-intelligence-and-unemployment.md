# Artificial Intelligence and Unemployment

The
idea of technological
unemployment
is
making
a
comeback, both in the labor
economics literature and in the
public, underscoring concerns that
job destruction could result from
technology advancement. This fear
stems from the belief that production
will be relentlessly automated as a
result of exponential technological
advancement.

Robotics and artificial intelligence
(AI) are two relatively new computer
science subfields that have fueled
this ambition. The first builds on
earlier technological revolutions that
have occurred throughout history and
attempts to lessen laboriousness,
advance technological frontiers, and
boost industrial effectiveness. The
invention of printing is credited to
Gutenberg in the mid-15th century,
despite evidence that Tang Dynasty
China had already mastered printing
techniques by the 8th century,
and modern printing presses have
contributed to accelerating the
diffusion of information by speeding
up printing while decreasing costs,
from manual loaves of parchment
to the modern cranes that build
ever taller skyscrapers. Robotics
contributes to this continuity by
drastically reducing the amount of
human labor required to operate
each unit of capital by automating
machine operation.

The pursuit of efficiency is
shared by artificial intelligence, but it
varies from earlier advancements in
that it does not automate cognitive
processes rather than manual ones.
In this way, the development of
computer science, which enables
speedy and simple computing of
tasks, is a continuation of the digital
revolution. In contrast to traditional
algorithms, which are static, artificial
intelligence (AI) differs in that it
is adaptive. A machine learning
algorithm is programmed to learn
how to accomplish a task, in contrast
to a standard algorithm, which is
programmed to perform a task.
When a task isn’t very complex, the
first method is far more effective and
uses up less time and resources.
The second way is significantly more
potent, though, since the level of
complexity rises and occasionally
produces a consequence that the
creators did not intend. This kind of
algorithm works especially well for
issues requiring tacit knowledge,
which is by nature challenging
to document. For instance, the
development of driverless vehicles
has advanced significantly thanks
to machine learning techniques.
Driving is a straightforward activity,
but it requires a high degree of
adaptability, which was exceedingly
challenging
to
achieve
with
conventional algorithms because it
would have required foreseeing every
scenario the car would encounter.

This research seeks to respond to
a single, straightforward question: Is
there actual evidence that the use of
robotics and AI technologies can lead
to higher unemployment? Because
the total result of employment
creation and destruction is what
counts to us in this situation—that is,
determining whether compensatory
mechanisms
are
effective—we
want to reason at the macro level.
The
classical
and
Keynesian
Schumpetarian
compensation
mechanisms were set out by Calvino
and Virgillito. The former includes
four different mechanisms: an
increase in labor demand in the
companies producing the process
innovations, a decline in prices as a
result of productivity gains that then
causes an increase in aggregate
demand, a decline in wages that
also increases labor demand, and an
increase in investment funded by the
drop in the unitary cost of production
brought on by process innovation
that prompts new hiring and
increases production. The second
category contains two mechanisms:
the introduction of new products
that open up new markets and hence
raise labor demand, and an increase
in pay due to productivity gains for
the workers who are still employed
by the company.

Optimistic
and
pessimistic
perspectives are both present
in discussions on technological
unemployment. In order to prevent
technical unemployment, Keynes
advocated for a reduction in working
hours, stating that “three-hour shifts
or a fifteen-hour week may put off
the problem for a great while.” Even
further, Rifkin predicted the end of
employment, imagining an almost
totally automated economy that
would generate an abundance of
products and services at a marginal
cost that was almost zero.

They discovered that certain
professions saw slower employment
development than other occupations,
and occasionally even a slight fall
in employment levels. The authors
draw attention to the fact that overall,
automation does not lead to a net
loss of jobs. Artificial intelligence
has little influence on employment,
but it does have a slight positive
impact on earnings, according
to Felten, who proposed the “AI
Occupational Impact” measure.
Acemoglu analyzed information on
online job postings and discovered
no link between exposure to AI and
employment or pay. Webb, who
found that jobs with high exposure
to automation technology witnessed
a fall in employment and income,
disagrees with this finding. Felten,
and Frey and Osborne are built
upon, Bessen’s investigation into
the relationship between jobs and
automation at the organizational
level came to the conclusion that
automation increases the risk of
employees leaving an organization.
However, they point out that this
impact is minor and gradual. In their
examination of a sample of Spanish
manufacturing companies, Koch
found that the adoption of robots
resulted in a 10% net growth in
jobs, whereas companies that did
not invest in robots had job losses
over the same time period. Using
French data, Aghion discovered
that automation has a favorable
effect on employment at both
the business and industry levels.
Montobbio emphasized a sector-
specific impact on manual and
cognitive activities by comparing
labor-saving robots patents with
firm-level statistics. There is a vast
body of work that discusses the
effects of process improvements on
employment in addition to studies
on robots and artificial intelligence.

In contrast to earlier studies that
showed no indication of a significant
relationship between the two, Van
Roy’s research found that process
innovation tended to enhance
employment.

While firm-level analysis has the
advantage of giving a lot of data,
frequently of higher quality than
macroeconomic data, it also has the
drawback of not offering a useful
framework for determining the
overall net impact of technological
advancement
on
employment.
Indeed, the creation of new jobs in
other firms or sectors may be able to
counterbalance certain job losses in
one company or industry. They did,
however, make note of the correlation
between rising robotization and
a decline in the employment
percentage of low-skilled individuals.
Acemoglu and Restrepo examined
the impact of robot density on local
labor markets in the US using a
task-based theoretical framework
and discovered that each additional
robot per thousand workers is
associated with a 0.2% decline in
the
employment-to-population
ratio and a 0.37% decline in wages.
By demonstrating that there is a
bigger negative impact on jobs and
hourly wages the less educated the
workers, they further highlighted the
heterogeneity of the consequences.

We
develop
four
research
hypotheses based on empirical
and theoretical literature. First, we
anticipate finding a link between the
overall unemployment rate, robots,
and AI (H1). While some writers have
emphasized a positive influence
on employment, the quantitative
impact of AI on jobs at the macro
level is currently understudied.
Second, we anticipate a positive
relationship between robots and
the unemployment rate of workers
with the lowest levels of education
and a negative relationship between
robots and those with higher
levels of education. According to
the skill-biased technical change
(SBTC), skilled employees profit
from technological advancement
while
unskilled
ones
suffer
negative effects. On the other
hand, we examine the claim that
AI and robotics primarily affect the
unemployment rate of people with
a medium level of expertise (H3).
This is in reference to the literature
on labor market polarization, which
claims that AI algorithms primarily
replace routine tasks carried out by
medium-skilled workers.

Finally, we anticipate varied
impacts within age groups and
within the same schooling group.
An “experience” effect and a
“knowledge obsolescence” impact
are two competing effects that can
be at work. Older workers typically
have more job experience, making
them more qualified at the same
educational level, which causes the
first effect. Older workers should
therefore be less susceptible
to technological unemployment
because their duties should be
more difficult than those of younger
workers. According to the second
effect, younger people tend to
be more technologically aware
than older people. For instance,
compared to their 55–64 year-old
peers with a same level of education,
25–34 year-olds tend to be more at
ease using computers and mobile
technology. For the best educated
workers, who are most likely to
work as data scientists, software
developers, robot engineers, etc.,
this effect makes the most sense.
