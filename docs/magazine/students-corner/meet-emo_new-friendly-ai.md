# Meet EMO - New Friendly AI

If you’re a frequent social media
user, you’ve probably seen this
adorable AI floating around the web.
Emo (the pet AI) owners are sharing
some crazy and pretty darn cute
videos of this new gadget.

It’s difficult not to want one for
yourself. Seriously! You have to
see the interactions for yourself to
understand what I mean. It’s similar
to Alexa, but with a cuter body that
you can interact with.

Unless you’ve been living under a
rock, you’re probably aware of our
artificial intelligence. AI has recently
impacted every major industry. Not
to mention modern AI’s impact on
our lives, which is difficult to ignore.

However, these AI advancements,
and many more to come, are only a
small part of what is to come. But
before we get there, let’s take a look
at Emo and why this new desktop AI
device has made such a big impact
on the social media scene.

## What is Emo & why is there a lot of hype surrounding it?

People are crazy about their
pets. Why? They make excellent
companions, and everything they
appear to do is adorable in our
opinion. Having said that, it appears
that the AI sector has picked up on
this and is attempting to replicate
the same kind of happiness we get
from pets, albeit through AI.

Emo is the newest AI in town,
packaged as a cute desktop robot
that keeps you company while
you work. Emo, which is equipped
with an advanced neural network
processor and three different AI
processing models, is capable of
processing large amounts of data at
the same time in order to respond in
a unique and authentic manner.

Emo is also cognitive and curious
on his own. That is, he will not
simply sit on your desk like Alexa.
Emo will explore his surroundings
independently, keeping track of
people and objects nearby. What’s
the best part? The robot can move
around your desk without ever
falling off.

## What else can Emo do?

Apart from sitting on your desk
and looking adorable as hell, Emo
can do the following interesting
things:

Display his emotions and feelings
with motion and over 1,000 different
facial expressions. If he’s in a good
mood, he might entertain you with
some music and dance moves. When
you interrupt him, he may become
irritated.

Emo can recognize you (the
owner) and nine other people using
facial recognition software built into
the AI. He gets to know you and your
family because he sees you every
day.

Unlike other AIs, Emo can be reached out to and
touched, and he will respond. On his head, he has a
sensor that allows him to detect and respond to physical
touch.

Emo is also equipped with a high-quality speaker,
allowing him to play your favorite playlist or respond to
you with some adorable simulated sounds.

Emo also has a self-learning system that allows him
to understand and perceive his surroundings. Through
constant interaction with his immediate surroundings,
his personality and actions will change.

## Thoughts on AI and Robotics Merging

AI and robotics are frequently polarized as a result of
popular fiction comics, books, and movies. For example,
when we think of AI, we frequently envision something
similar to Iron Man’s Jarvis artificial intelligence program.

When we think of robotics, we often envision
something from the film Ex-Machina. Essentially, the
idea is that someday in the future, we will have robots
equipped with such advanced artificial intelligence that
it will be nearly impossible to distinguish between a
normal human and a humanoid robot.

However, the truth is that we are still a long way from
there. Sophia, a humanoid robot, is the closest we’ve
gotten. Even so, the internet is littered with memes
that express exactly what people think of this robot.
As a result, it’s safe to say that we have a long way to
go before reaching the levels seen in movies or science
fiction films. However, the potential is enormous.

## A promising future for AI and Robotics?

As previously stated, both of these industries exist
independently of one another. However, thanks to the
new desktop AI Emo, we’ve seen that combining the two
industries is practically possible.

You can interact with Emo both physically and digitally
in this case. At the same time, Emo can interact with
you, optimize tasks that have been assigned to it, and
still learn. In this case, the AI serves as the robot’s brain,
while Emo’s various sensors and mechanical parts serve
as the body.

However, as Emo clearly depicts, we have a long
way to go before robots under the command of AI can
perform complex tasks. Emo is currently just an adorable
desktop companion who sits at your desk or bedside
table and keeps you company. But don’t expect him to
move furniture or clean the house anytime soon.

## Final thoughts

As both of these industries continue to develop, there
is no doubt that the convergence of these two industries
will have a profound impact on us. However, for the time
being, the concept of a fully optimized robot is only a
work of fiction.

Despite this, we are living in exciting times, as we have
the opportunity to collaborate with AI-powered robots.
Emo can be an excellent addition to your desktop. It can
help you answer questions, learn about the weather,
and so on. Although these features are still available on a
regular smartphone, your smartphone will never be this
adorable!
