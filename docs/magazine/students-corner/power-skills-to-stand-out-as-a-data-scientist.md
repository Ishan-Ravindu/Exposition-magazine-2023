# Power Skills to Stand Out as a Data Scientist

`" Knowledge is power "`

This is a famous proverb by the British philosopher Sir Francis
Bacon from his publication Meditationes Sacrae, which dates
back to 1597. It has been repeated and expanded by many
throughout history. This idea is often brought into discussion,
especially in the business world, as well applied knowledge is a
competitive advantage that creates power.

Moving backward to see how knowledge is created, the
wisdom hierarchy illustrates that knowledge is defined in terms
of information. Information is defined in terms of data. Data
refers to unprocessed facts and figures. However, data alone
can tell you nothing. Transforming data into information is the
fundamental objective. The information in action can be defined
as knowledge, and the purpose of it is to be useful in a particular
domain or different domains. As you go forward reading, you
can now figure out that knowledge can be derived from data that
empowers people, businesses, and almost all the things around
us. Therefore, let us refine the proverb into, “Data is power”.

## What is data science?

The field of study known as data science works with massive
volumes of data using cutting-edge tools and methods to
uncover hidden patterns, derive actionable insights, and make
strategic decisions.

## A role of a data scientist

A data scientist is someone who analyzes business data
to extract actionable insights. He follows a series of steps
to solve critical business problems. As the first step, a data
scientist attempts to understand the context of the problem
and the problem precisely by asking the right questions from
stakeholders. Then he determines the required sets of data and
the correct set of variables.

As the next step, the data scientist gathers structured and
unstructured data from multiple sources. After the data is
collected, he transforms the raw data into a format that can
be used for analysis. This process involves data cleaning and
validation, which ensures consistency, comprehensiveness,
and accuracy. Then the data is fed into the analytical system,
and he analyzes and identifies patterns and trends in data.
From that, the data scientist interprets the data in a way that
helps to resolve the existing problems. Finally, he prepares the
findings and insights to share with the business stakeholders
and communicates them to relevant parties. Does it sound
complicated?

Maybe, but here is one major reason why you should aspire
toward a career in the data science domain. As Glassdoor and
Forbes suggest, the demand for data scientists will rise by

26 percent by 2026. Therefore, it is worth putting effort into
developing both technical and professional skills in you to fit into
a job role in the data science domain. Keep reading to get to
know some valuable power skills that will help you outshine the
rest!

## Power skills

In its 2022 Workplace Learning Trends Report, Udemy
Business introduced the term “power skills” to characterize
those attributes once referred to as “soft skills,” elevating them
as the top competencies required to succeed at any level
within an organization. The term “soft” skills does not stress the
importance of mastering these skills; therefore, “power skills”
sounds a better fit. Here are some significant power skills that
are not common in discussions but are very important in today’s
dynamic working environment.

1. Confidently protecting your turf

   When it comes to your job role and job description as a data
   scientist, not everyone will define it the same way. The position
   described to you at the interview, and your role at work can be
   completely different from each other. This can happen in a
   business context where the management is struggling with
   implementing a sound analytics strategy. In such a situation,
   as a confident data scientist, you should proactively suggest
   the kinds of projects you can get involved in that benefit the
   team and the whole organization. Select the projects which are
   challenging as well as rewarding. Showcase your analytical skills
   and demonstrate the best version of the data scientist in you.

2. Cognitive empathy

   As a data scientist, there are times that you have to put
   yourself in someone’s shoes to figure out the way they think.
   With cognitive empathy, we try to understand someone’s
   thought process that led to a particular decision. When
   observing a dataset, there can be certain things that you notice
   but which are not visible in the business context. Also, there can
   be things that are not visible in the data set but can be seen
   in the business context. Therefore, having cognitive empathy
   supports interpretation and generation of insights and, finally, to
   build better models.

3. Curiosity

   A data scientist needs to be curious to find answers to known
   business problems and uncover overlooked solutions. The
   key to stand out is to continue asking questions, pushing the
   boundaries of your knowledge and keep exploring things. Being
   curious in these situations is beneficial. However, you should
   know when to stop exploring and start taking action with the
   data you possess. Keep in mind that there is always something
   to learn, regardless of the type of data you are working with.

4. Persuasion

   Do not expect persuasion to be easy. After you complete
   building your solution to the business problem, you should
   convince the stakeholders that you have solved their problem.
   These stakeholders may be skeptical and non-technical, but you
   have to present your solution in a way that everyone can grasp
   it. The teams will be questioning you, doubting the numbers you
   show and asking to add more features to the model, however
   you should have the ability to defend your solution both logically
   and practically. Before presenting your solution, ask yourself, “if I
   were them, what would I be focusing on?”

5. Commitment to hone your craft

   As a data scientist, you should know the new tools,
   technologies, and trends out there. Reading related books,
   reading online content, and attending conferences are a few
   things you can do to invest your time. You should ensure that you
   keep up with the pace of technology and develop professionally
   to fit into the ever-changing technology. The technical skills you
   have now could be completely obsolete in a few years or maybe
   in a few months. Therefore, being up-to date is crucial to add
   value to your position.

You can focus on these power skills to outshine yourself as
an inspiring data scientist in the organization. Some of the skills
you just read might not have been in your discussions, but many
of you might have felt the importance of these while playing the
role of a data scientist at your organization. Having the required
technical skills is necessary, but the power skills will make you
stand out.
