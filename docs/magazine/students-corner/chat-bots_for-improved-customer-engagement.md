# Chatbots: For Improved Customer Engagement

The chatbot is an abbreviation of “chatterbots”. It is
an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based Human-Computer
interaction tool. The terms “talkbot,” “smart bot,” “IM
bot,” “interactive agent,” and “artificial conversation
agent” are all synonyms for the term “chatbot.” Users
can interact with chatbots 24/7 from anywhere and on
any smart device, making chatbots one of the best tools
for businesses.

Research by Yellow.ai and C-Zentrix predicts that the
value of global voice assistant transactions will increase
by 320% between 2021 and 2023. Additionally, according
to Stamford (2022), research by Gartner Inc. revealed
that by 2027, a fourth of businesses will use chatbots
as their primary technique for customer relations.
Therefore, a deeper understanding of chatbots and their
standing in the global community is crucial.

The idea behind the technology traces back to 1950
when Alan Turing published a paper on “Computing
Machinery and Intelligence”. This introduced the “Turing
Test” as a measure of intelligence and suggested the
possibility of a computer program to think and respond
like a human to a real-time conversation, by exhibiting
man’s thought processes and behavioral qualities.
To this day, the Turing Test evaluates the extent to
which a computer displays human thinking, primarily
when interrogated.
The notion stimulated Joseph
Weizenbaum, who developed ELIZA in 1964. ELIZA is an
early natural language processing system that marked
the beginning of Artificial Intelligence. The primary
concept utilized by ELIZA is pattern matching. Through
a simple conversation with ELIZA, a version developed
by Michael Wallace, it became apparent that ELIZA is
programmed to mostly re-direct the words typed by
the person in a questioning format. Thus, it is not very
accommodating for general conversations. Despite its
limitations, ELIZA is considered the first chatbot.

Today, chatbots have expanded to every virtual field,
to not only function as a conversationalist but also as
smart personal voice assistants and tools for increased
customer engagement. Some common applications of
chatbots in several areas are as follows.

## Customer Service

95% of consumers believe that the main application
of chatbots is in the customer service or online retail
industry. This is very much apparent when looking at real-
world examples of using chatbots to answer frequently
asked questions and provide mundane support services
like redirecting to related URLs. Using customer chatbots
allow customer service agents to dedicate themselves
to more complex requests, leaving simpler tasks for
the bot to manage and thereby increasing overall
productivity. Other advantages include 24x7 availability,
instant support, easy scalability, automating of social
media support and collecting real-time feedback. For
example, the Jenny Chatbot used by Slush oversaw
64% of its customer requests. Customizing responses
to best-fit customer needs involves the use of complex
omnichannel synthesis.

## Health

The healthcare sector also utilizes chatbots to
ease its activities, and this is not limited to answering
general inquiries. For example, Babylon Health uses
chatbots to provide consultations to patients based
on their past medical records and also direct patients
to a live e-channelling session with a related medical
professional. The bot makes note of the patient’s
symptoms and either recommend them to a doctor or
provides explanations of the disease with instructions
on what to do next. Healthcare bots are also prevalent
in related applications, and they assist with tailoring the
user experience in line with their health requirements.
There are chatbots developed to function as therapists
for mental health related issues, and they are designed
to intuitively reach out to a real therapist when in need.

## Education

In education, chatbots have proven useful as teacher’s
assistants. Learn bots have recording features that
repeat lessons to students who have missed them. Some
chatbots remind students of upcoming assignments,
quizzes, and other due tasks. Educational institutions
implement chatbots to ease their administration-related
tasks like enrolling students in courses, generating class
and exam timetables, allocating instructors based on
availability and even compiling result reports based on
students’ performance. Moreover, chatbots are heavily
used in foreign language learning. The ability to use a
chatbot to practice a language from any place at any
time has encouraged most students to involve chatbots
in their learning process. Many have revealed that they
are more comfortable practicing their language skills
with a chatbot rather than with a teacher or instructor.

## Banking and Finance

Chatbots have also made their mark in the banking and
finance sector. The ability to process user requirements
and needs has made chatbots an integral part of this field.
Chatbots assist banking customers by tracking money
transfers, recharging bills, sending timely notifications,
providing personal banking assistance, and ensuring
secure transfers. Smart bots tackle suspicious activity
before things get out of hand. The HDFC bank uses the
Eva Chatbot to quickly understand customer inquiries
and resolve them accordingly. Additionally, banks or
financial institutions can implement tailored chatbots
that assist clients in starting accounts or requesting
loans.

## Recreation and Entertainment

Entertainment content can help people bond, and
chatbots are becoming increasingly popular in the
industry with their ability to engage with users. Many
bots are created for entertainment, boredom dispersers
or even feedback collectors. The Discord server provides
a platform to choose from a wide range of chatbots for
role-playing games, game notifications and player rank
calculators or boosters. Moreover, chatbots are capable
of sending files in different formats. This increases their
versatility while increasing user immersion. Even in the
recreation industry, hotels, or travel agents use chatbots
to maximize customer service by suggesting the best
tourist attractions according to client requirements,
checking the availability of tickets or bookings and
making them.

Despite the use of Artificial Intelligence and its
widespread application, chatbots are still limited. There
are situations when chatbots fail to understand what the
customer request and provide nonsensical answers or
attempt to deviate from the topic.

At the end of the day, no matter how advanced, a bot
has no real thoughts or feelings. Hence, people should
be aware of the situations where they engage with a
chatbot and respond or interact, knowing that it is just a
programmed “being.” Technology is ever evolving. It is guaranteed that
chatbots will continue to develop over the years and
be integrated into every field with better text or voice
experiences and enhanced capabilities. This will also
improve the business side of things, with a deeper
understanding of client behaviour and statistics
to improve overall customer satisfaction and firm
productivity.

The popularity of voice assistants like Siri, Alexa, and
Cortana is expected to increase, with voice recognition
in any language or accent being the most distinctive
feature of
chatbots. Companies hope to involve
advanced chatbots that can intuitively respond to every
client inquiry.

There is an increased demand for intelligent virtual
assistants that can self-learn. Its adaptation in smart
homes and businesses is forecasted to significantly
increase the market value. Conversational chatbots
are also becoming more involved in the market, with
greater emphasis on localizing the chatbot and making
it accommodate foreign visitors. This will contribute
to improving the tourism industry through the ability to
converse in many languages effortlessly.

Since its initiation in the mid-20th century, chatbots
have rapidly improved over the years. From a simple
chatbot that provided a few generic responses, the
industry has developed the technology to an extent
where some people fail to recognize that they are not
interacting with a human being. For all its advancements,
primarily in the business sector, chatbots still have
their flaws. There is definite room for growth and
improvement.
