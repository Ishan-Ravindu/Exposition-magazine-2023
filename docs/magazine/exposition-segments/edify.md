## INTER-UNIVERSITY ARTICLE COMPETITION

Exposition continues the second iteration of the inter-university article competition in addition to the long-
running intra-departmental article competition to ignite the zeal of Sri Lankan university studentsâ€™ minds.
The enthusiastic participation in the competition with the motivation to publish their creative thoughts in the
Exposition magazine implicitly reflected the success of this uplift.

## INTRA-DEPARTMENT ARTICLE COMPETITION

The intra-departmental article competition is a chance for MIT undergraduates to showcase their writing
skills and share their ideas. Participants are encouraged to submit articles on a variety of topics relevant to
Information Technology, Management and Entrepreneurship with the winning entry being featured in the
Exposition magazine. Not only does this competition provide a platform for MITians to express themselves,
but it also promotes knowledge sharing and fosters a sense of community.
