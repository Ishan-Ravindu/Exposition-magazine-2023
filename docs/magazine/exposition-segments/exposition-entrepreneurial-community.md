# Exposition Entrepreneurial Community

The Exposition Entrepreneurial Community, introduced by Exposition, is a platform to bring together entrepreneurs in different
fields of the industry in Sri Lanka to help discover and discuss new ideas.

The main stakeholders in the EEC are the small and medium-scale entrepreneurs in the island. These entrepreneurs are innovators
and risk-takers. They are the sources of new ideas, which evolve into goods, services, or business procedures. They play a vital role in
the economy by contributing their skills to develop and uplift the industry and economy.

## The EEC consists of two main phases:

- Sri Lankan Entrepreneurial Database
- The Online Community Forum

## SLEDB - Sri Lankan Entrepreneurial Database

SLEDB is a knowledge base that consists of information and
profiles of SME sector entrepreneurs. The main objective of the SLEDB
is to create a linkage between material suppliers and entrepreneurs in
the SME sector. Entrepreneurs can gather considerable knowledge on
maintaining a business, managing resources, and the challenges of
sustaining a business through EEC. Given the number of entrepreneurs
who do not have a notable IT or Management background, we MITians
have recognized it as our responsibility to facilitate their requirements
and assist them in becoming successful. We hope to form alliances with
various organizations in order to meet the needs of entrepreneurs in
the SME sector. Additionally, entrepreneurs themselves get the chance
to know each other and create links between themselves. The EEC will
provide excellent opportunities for SME sector entrepreneurs to grow
their businesses in the future.

## The Online Community Forum

The online community links the entrepreneurs of the community
while opening doors to exchange new ideas and knowledge among
experts and enthusiasts in the industry. The online community is a
knowledge pool that facilitates all the entrepreneurship enthusiasts
and passionate entrepreneurs out there to expand their horizons by
exchanging expertise within the community. Currently, this platform is
operating as a Facebook group, which consists of over 1400 community
members. This is the best platform to explore new trends and achieve
the next best level of their business. It provides consultation via virtual
brainstorming sessions conducted by the industrial experts who have
already joined hands with our online platform.
