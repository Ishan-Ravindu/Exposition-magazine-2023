## How did your first three years at the Department of Industrial Management influence you to continue to the 4th academic year?

As undergraduates in the Department of Industrial
Management, we engage in various activities apart from
academic activities. Almost everyone engages in extracurricular
activities as well as in organizing various events at the
department. Therefore, we all get together and work as one team
to make everything a success. It was a wonderful time we had in
our first three years.

Moreover, the lecturers, non-academic staff, and my
batchmates had a strong relationship as the IM family rather
than an academic-oriented department. With that homely
experience, I could develop both technical and soft skills in a
relaxed mind while improving my professional competencies.
That experience at the department influenced me to continue to
the 4th academic year.

## What steps did you take to get to Level 4 undergraduate status in one of the most important degree programs, and what difficulties did you encounter while pursuing your education?

It was a wonderful time in my first year at the Department
of Industrial Management since all the lectures were held at the
university premises. At the same time, we had various events
where we got together and worked as one team. I participated in
some startup challenges and hackathons as well. It was a time
full of learning and amusement at the same time.

I used my free time to play chess at the University Chess club.
But from half of my second year on, we had to face the COVID-19
pandemic and transform it into online lectures, and we were also
engaged in organizing cooperative events. Therefore, changing
to an online setup was a bit challenging initially because it was
new to all of us.

However, I had to physically go to the office during my
internship, where many of the people were affected by
COVID-19. I had to come across that and perform my work there
with all the challenges around the environment. After three years,
I was eager to return to the department and continue on to the 4th
academic year since it is the final year of my undergraduate life
at the Department of Industrial Management. I always wanted
to explore new things and grab knowledge while engaging
in extracurricular activities. Hence, the final year is the best
opportunity, where we have to conduct research according to
scientific methodologies. It is a totally new experience that adds
more value to academic activities and future careers.

## What is your specialized area in the degree program? And how did you get passionate about that area?

I specialize in Operations and Supply Chain Management.
After my A/L examinations, I applied for B.Sc. in MIT with
the ambition of choosing Operations and Supply Chain
Management as my specialization area. During the first three
years, I realized the impact the Supply Chain industry has
made on nearly every facet of the modern lives of people. It is
one of the most diversified fields in the business sector as it is
interconnected with all other functions. Because supply chain
management is rapidly expanding, and it is also expected to
grow even in the height of a recession. There are various career
path options, like different sub-sectors, where a person can learn
a lot while ensuring a positive growth career with a good salary.
Hence, during our degree program, my passion for following this
specialization area was improved with the vast area of modules
that we had, capturing both IT and management.

## How did the MIT degree program benefit you in achieving a successful internship?

I had the opportunity to work as an intern in one of the leading
apparel exporting companies in Sri Lanka, which is also the
largest apparel tech company in South Asia. I was working as a
shipping and logistics intern while also engaging with some of
their automation projects. It was an amazing experience. I saw
the real-world implications of what we have learned over three
years. I had an opportunity to learn the export and import process
of apparel in Sri Lanka, and apply what I know to automate their
daily routine activities, such as documentary work. Those six
months were my very first industry experience, and they gave
me an understanding of the corporate world and workplace
culture, best practices, and many more. All my gratitude goes
to my degree program because our department has very good
coordination for providing internship opportunities for the whole
batch.

## How did you land a Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador opportunity during your undergraduate period? In what way did MIT pave the way for this opportunity?

Anyone enrolled as a full-time undergraduate in an accredited
academic institution can apply for Microsoft Learn Student
Ambassador Program. MIT degree program was the foundation
for me to apply and successfully get through the selection
process. Because as an MIT undergraduate, I was passionate
about exploring new knowledge and skills while sharing what
I knew with others. To explain a bit about the Microsoft Learn
Student Ambassador Program, it provides plenty of opportunities
for you to learn and lead, allowing you to make a difference and
empower those around you. Student Ambassadors get the
opportunity to connect with other students worldwide, and their
online communities, get training and certifications, and tackle
practical challenges, all while building key technical and soft
skills to help them succeed.

## How did your experience at the department pave the way for the success of your research project?

It was a completely new experience to conduct research in
the fourth year of our degree program. Our department always
encourages us and helps with every part to do it successfully.
All the lecturers, including our research supervisors, support us
a lot in carrying on the research projects without any problems.
We have received immense knowledge from all the conducted
sessions, especially data analysis workshops.

## How has the MIT degree program helped you lay the foundation for advancing to a full-time professional career?

MIT degree program paved the way to a professional career
from the first day at the Department of Industrial Management.
I gained knowledge in numerous avenues, and I improved my
soft skills day by day. This degree program laid the foundation
to build my professional image with more productivity and
efficiency. How we learn, behave, talk, and work has been shaped
throughout the years. Not only having a versatile knowledge of
management and Information Technology, but we also develop
our careers through personal progress development activities,
outbound training, and many more.

The internship program was another turning point that gave
me an excellent experience to start a professional career. Those
six months I completed was a great achievement and a fresh
beginning.

## As an ambitious student with a distinguished degree, in what ways have your experiences led you to become the aspired person you are today?

All these four years at the Department of Industrial
Management were unforgettable roller-coaster rides with
never-ending learning opportunities. Not only excelling in
academic activities, the experiences at DIM have also provided
opportunities to build a strong network with good collaboration.

## What advice have you got to offer your junior undergraduates at the Department of Industrial Management ?

These four years as an undergraduate will never return to your
life again. These four years at the university will be a wonderful
journey that you go through. You will meet new people, learn new
skills, face challenges, and have many new experiences. You
are in safe hands, and the inheritance you gain through this alma
mater is amazing. Your opportunities are immense, and I want
to tell you not to be afraid or step down in front of challenges.
Having more academic work to do in addition to participating in
extracurricular activities, planning events, and working on your
projects, will be the foundation of your future job. One day, youâ€™ll
become stronger and more talented with that inspiration and
motivation. Enjoy your time as a student, dream about the future,
and start preparing for it now.
