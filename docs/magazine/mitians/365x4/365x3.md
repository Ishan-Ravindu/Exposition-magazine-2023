# The Intern

## What is your chosen career path and what ignited that passion?

As MITians, most of our career paths would be in the IT
industry since we have the privilege to excel in both IT and
management domains. With that, my passion is in Business
Analysis and Project Management, where I get to deal with
different stakeholders at different levels across the industry.
I’ve always been someone who enjoyed being with people and
hanging around with them while tackling new challenges each
day. I think that’s one of the main reasons that I chose Business
Analysis as a career path over others.

## How crucial do you think it is for undergraduates to participate in extracurricular activities throughout their time at university?

My answer to question would be, “That’s probably the best
way you can experience the so-called University Life,” since
participating in extracurricular activities is crucial and important
in an undergraduate’s life. You cannot even think of getting the
whole package of experiences unless you are participating
in any of the extracurricular activities. There are many sports,
clubs, and societies, as well as student communities and other
events that undergraduates can get involved in. It provides
undergraduates the opportunity to develop new skills, identify
strengths and weaknesses, and help them grow their network.
Each of these will be a whole new experience for them. Thus, it
is really important to participate in extracurricular activities, while
balancing academics to get the maximum out of your university
experience.

## What inspired you to participate in and win several hackathons, and what kind of support did you receive from the department to accomplish these victories?

Actually, it was a whole new experience for all of us on our
team. Our team leader had many creative and innovative ideas,
and we as a team thought of applying to different competitions,
just for the sake of getting new experiences. But along the
journey, we realized that our ideas and the solutions we came up with were creative and competitive enough to meet the
standards. And we are really grateful for the immense support
that we received from the Department of Industrial Management
and our fellow undergraduates. It would not have been possible
for us to compete and achieve some victories if not for their
support and guidance. And I truly believe that it has been a huge
milestone in all our team members’ lives.

## You were the former captain of the UOK Athletics team. How did you manage to balance your academics with extracurriculars?

I wouldn’t lie and say that there hadn’t been hard days
because managing both takes a lot of effort and time. It’s all
about how brilliantly you allocate the right amount of time and
priority to both. I don’t treat sports and academics differently,
and thereby I have always tried to balance them out equally.
There is no hard and fast rule as to how you manage, it comes
with practice and also dedication. Consistency is the key, with
consistence and perseverance comes success in everything
that you want to achieve.

## As an all-arounder, how has your time at university benefited you so far in honing your talents and abilities?

Honestly speaking, the time I spent at our university was
extremely limited due to the never ending pandemic that struck
the whole country. Consequently, we were all forced into online
education and digital learning, which come with their own share
of upsides and downsides, just like the two sides of a coin. But
that didn’t stop us from showcasing our abilities because we
used virtual platforms to organize a variety of programs and
events. That being said, the university provided us with multiple
opportunities for public speaking, executing and leading
programs, moderating/oration and they also expanded their
scope to overseas programs that helped us work alongside
international candidates and upgrade the standards of ourselves
and the MIT program.

## How is your experience at SRIQ Corporation (Pvt) Ltd as an intern?

In one word, it’s astounding. Every workplace is defined by
the human resource and of course SRIQ has a lovely dynamic
staff, that is always very welcoming and enthusiastic to guide
us through this internship journey. Besides the professional side,
we celebrate various events together and it’s been only few
months now, but I feel like I belong there already, like one place,
one family. To speak on the work itself, as interns we don’t have
an obligation as to what we pursue, we are given the freedom
to pick the cup of tea we like, and my designation is Functional
Consultant and I really enjoy working there.

## Could you go into more detail regarding the exposure to the industry you are receiving through the internship?

Our internship is based on Microsoft Dynamics which is
integrated with managing and providing ERP solutions for
companies that look forward to migrating to Business Central.
Microsoft Dynamics is one of the leading business solutions
that companies seek in order to move from legacy systems
to more advanced ones that are enveloped with extended
Warehousing, Purchasing and Procurement, Sales and Marketing
functionalities. Moreover, we learn the insights of Power BI and
Power Apps and incorporate them into our learning to enhance
the business process.

## In what ways has the MIT degree program aided you with your internship?

First things first, without MIT I wouldn’t have found this job, so MIT
took the initial step to place us in different companies and brought
us into this corporate world. Next, the degree program itself is a
very integral program that consists of various resourceful courses
that help facilitate this internship session. Also, the experience we
gain through the intensive learning process, practical sessions,
presentation skills and technical knowledge, help us in each and
every point of our internship. MIT did not spoon-feed us everything,
they paved way for us to self-learn various aspects of the study,
developed our analytical skills and this is a remarkable strategy for
personal and professional growth.

## After graduating from the Department of Industrial Management, what do you envision for your future professional life?

I think we need to love what we do. Whatever we do with a sense
of interest never goes out of style. And never stop learning no matter
how high we climb up the career ladder or how much knowledge
we gather, because life has its dramatic way of teaching us new
things every day. Although time and tide don’t matter in this learning
phase, we need to be mindful that now is the time to establish a solid
foundation for the benefit of our future. Further, without sticking
solely to one particular field, having our hands dipped in every pie
will provide us with vast acquaintance, knowledge and experience.
It helps us expand our career opportunities without limits. Supply
Chain Management has been my first professional choice but with
the experience I gained at SRIQ in ERP Consulting and Microsoft
Dynamics I would like to progress ahead in any one of those fields.

## As an MIT undergraduate, what message do you have to present to your fellow undergraduates?

There’s a saying that the university is a kitchen where you get all
the ingredients you want, and you are the chef who is responsible
for preparing yourself the best meal in the whole world. At university,
you will get different opportunities to participate in various events,
competitions, clubs and societies, sports and so on which will help
you to mold yourself to the person you want to become in the future.
Therefore, my advice would be to grab as many opportunities as
you can, that come along your journey and you will never regret that
decision once you start getting satisfaction when you look back on
yourself.
