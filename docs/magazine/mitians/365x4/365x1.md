## What was it like for you to go from a school student to an undergraduate at the Department of Industrial Management?

Being selected to follow MIT at the Department of Industrial
Management is the best thing that has happened to me. Of
course, being an undergraduate is different from a school
student, but being an MITian in University of Kelaniya is a rare,
lifetime opportunity. Even though absorbing the difference and
grabbing the new environment was not quite challenging, I think
the department handled us as pros as always. After coming
to the department, I started to see the world from a bigger
perspective and imagine myself in a very new way that I’ve not
seen so far. It made me dream and wonder about me being a
whole new, different person that I’ve not seen in my school time.
Most importantly, with DIM, I believe that the best is yet to come.

## How do you think this degree program will help you pursue your passions?

Learning management and IT even though you are a science
student is not an easy chance. I was passionate about starting
my own business, but I didn’t know how to pursue that with
my study area. Except after starting to study at DIM, I gradually
started on drawing and sketching the plan. The content of the
degree program allows us to think as more analytical and logical
problem solvers with the ability to handle big data. I still have a
long way to go, but I am confident that I can improve further and
be a dream chaser.

## According to you, what inspires the MITians the most to become outstanding?

They are guiding us to imagine, think novelly, and be
innovative, and encouraging us to go beyond our comfort
zones while learning who we really are. I think these concepts
are breaking barriers in our heads that we had in our school
period, and it’s amazing how they are guiding us step by step.
They encourage us to get involved in a variety of extracurricular
activities so that we can become well-rounded members of
society. Moreover, the academic staff, the non-academic staff,
and the seniors are supportive and motivated to carry us with
them without any difference. This culture in the department
itself is the main difference I see from other departments or
universities in our country. That, in my opinion, is what propels
the department to the next level.

## After entering the Department of Industrial Management, what changes have you already noticed in yourself?

I started to see the world differently. I learned that diverse
talents can be developed in a person and can bring about
significant change. At first and still, even the subject contents
were hard to follow because they were entirely new to most of
the students. But it creates flexibility and the skill of learning
quickly in students. I also discover more capabilities in myself,
such as being good at communication, handling people,
discovering their skills and abilities, and identifying the risks
beforehand. Also, I should improve my skills in public speaking,
communication, and leadership throughout the next few years
of study to become the person I want to be. I’m hoping that DIM
can help me gain these qualities.
