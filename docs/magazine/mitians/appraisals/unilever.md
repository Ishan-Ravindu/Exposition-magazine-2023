# APPRAISALS

My real engagement with the
Department of Industrial Management
as corporate personnel started
when I joined Unilever. Through
Unilever, I began to interact with the
undergraduates in the department.
I felt that more than IT graduates,
MITians
have
more
business
acumen. Business acumen is a sound
understanding of the whole business
world and its operations.

To
get
business
acumen,
understanding
the
business
environment is vital, so you need
to work on the ground. This is why
internships are important. When you
are exposed to the corporate world
during an internship, your perspective
changes. You begin to understand
that regardless of background, what
matters in the corporate world is
your language skill, technical skill,
and knowledge. This understanding
is an eye-opener in the sense that
you realize how you could have
used your time and knowledge more
productively. This is the value of
having an internship.

On the other hand, the advantage
for
multinational
corporations,
especially FMCG, is that we are
not purely IT businesses. We need
people involved in business and
manufacturing. But to deliver our
products faster, we also need IT
support.

The challenge with recruiting
hard-core IT professionals is that
they struggle to decode the business
language into their IT language. So, we
need to look for a translator who can
understand business and IT. Through
the graduates and undergraduates
from the Department of Industrial
Management, this gap between the
technology experts and the business
experts is bridged.

What we look for in graduates is
an open mind, the ability to accept
challenges, modesty, a thirst for new
knowledge, and the willingness to
try new things. Corporations look
for people who are self-starters,
self-motivators, and keen on self-
development. What makes MITians
unique is that they are open to change,
removing the “I know everything” hat,
and welcoming new knowledge.

MITians also have high technical
competence. They have sound
knowledge of the subject, are very
structured, and are disciplined. Based
on my experience, MIT graduates
are more competent in terms of
the quality and practicality of their
subject content. Unlike hard-core
IT or Management undergraduates
who have theoretical knowledge but
struggle to convert it into a practical
scenario, MIT undergraduates are
well-balanced.
