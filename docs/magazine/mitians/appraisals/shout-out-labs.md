# APPRAISALS

The Department of Industrial
Management at the University of
Kelaniya has consistently produced
competent and motivated graduates
who bring knowledge, eagerness
to learn, and adaptability to new
situations in the industry. Over
the past three years, ShoutOUT
Labs has had the pleasure of
engaging with the department in the
recruitment of interns and graduates
in the areas of Software Engineering,
Business Analysis, and Project/
Product Management. We have
been consistently impressed with
the quality of interns and graduates
we have worked with.

Their ability to lead important
projects with confidence and
ease sets them apart from
graduates of other universities and
demonstrates their value as assets
to any organization. This can be
attributed to the well-structured
curriculum of the course, which
covers both software engineering
and management aspects, providing
students with a comprehensive
education.

Our company, ShoutOUT Labs,
has been fortunate to work with
outstanding graduates who have
delivered
exceptional
results,
demonstrating a great passion
for learning and leading some of
our most significant projects. We
are proud to have been able to
play a role in helping them identify
their passions and enhance their
knowledge.

In conclusion, we would like
to extend our sincere gratitude
to the Department of Industrial
Management at the University of
Kelaniya for providing us with such
talented and ca pable individuals
and for their valuable contributions
to our company. We value our
relationship with the Department
of Industrial Management at the
University of Kelaniya and look
forward to extending this partnership
in the future.

We also wish the students all the
best for their upcoming Exposition
magazine launch.
