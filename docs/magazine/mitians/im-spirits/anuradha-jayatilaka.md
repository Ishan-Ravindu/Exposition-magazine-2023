I stepped into the University of Kelaniya as an MIT undergraduate in 2018 and
completed my bachelor’s degree in 2022, specializing in operations and supply
chain management. Unfortunately, due to the COVID pandemic that started in
2020, our 3rd and 4th academic years were held remotely. We had to complete our
individual development projects and research work during this period, which was
really challenging. But it was a great and very valuable experience for us. During
our undergraduate period, we got the opportunity to work with a very friendly and
supportive academic staff who guided us not only in our academics but also in every
obstacle we faced in our lives. They were always behind us to lend their helping
hands; this supportiveness allowed us to successfully complete our academics and
engage in extracurricular activities as well.

As MITians we get the opportunity to engage in a 6-month industrial training
where we get a great industrial experience supervised through our lecturers as well.
This exposure and the combination of management and IT knowledge and skills
we get throughout our undergraduate period makes us unique in the industry and
helps us a lot to secure very good career placements, entering the industry as fresh
graduates. As I was a part of the university chess women’s team throughout my
undergraduate period, it helped me with soft skill development and analytical skills
as well. I think these helped me to secure a satisfactory career placement soon after
completing my final semester examinations.

The self-development, skills, competencies, and guidance we get from the
Department of Industrial Management throughout our undergraduate period makes
us successful individuals. It was a great opportunity to be a part of the IM family.
