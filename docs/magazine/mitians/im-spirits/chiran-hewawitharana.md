In 2018, I enrolled in Bachelor’s in Management and Information Technology degree program at the Department of
Industrial Management with the aim of grooming myself as an outstanding professional.

Within the last four years, the learning environment, along with the supportive and enthusiastic culture prevailing in
the department, has resulted in my achieving the projected milestones in my academic journey. The lecturers always
motivated us to nurture our character and attitude, sculptured with professionalism. The induction gained through the
former MITians was invaluable since they always guided us and supported us when choosing the learning paths to
develop our career goals step by step. During the COVID pandemic period, we were able to resolve all the obstacles we
underwent with the methodical teaching mechanisms followed by the lecturers and complete our academic coursework
related to our bachelor’s up to the intended timeline. Also, the department did not hesitate to facilitate further new
learning opportunities via renowned platforms like Coursera, edX and Udemy. I believe the inheritance received from the
supportive panel of lecturers along with the challenging learning experience acquired during this pandemic period led
me to drive my passion towards the Data Science Engineering field, ending up reserving myself as a Data Engineer in
one of the renowned software companies in Sri Lanka.

The Department of Industrial Management is not only a dedicated institution for academics, but also comprises many
programs designed for undergraduates to enhance their skills related to management and leadership aspects through
the Industrial Management Science Students’ Association (IMSSA). The undergraduates receive the opportunity to
organize multiple events together with the industrial entities. Hence, the MITians receive the capability to showcase
their maximum potential by interacting with the industry. Being the Chief Coordinator of hackX 2019, myself and hackX
team were able to revamp the traditional hackathon culture, and conduct the event as a startup incubation program,
recognized by many IT entities in Sri Lanka.

I strongly believe the inheritance acquired through this wonderful institution was the key factor to grooming myself
as a confident professional, and the inspiration would definitely result in sustaining my personal and professional life in
the future. I am forever grateful for being a part of the IM family.
