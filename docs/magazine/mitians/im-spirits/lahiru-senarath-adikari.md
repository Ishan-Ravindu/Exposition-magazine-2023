My decision to pursue a bachelorâ€™s degree in Industrial Management was entirely coincidental. I stepped into a whole
new environment without having any clue about what was going to happen. Lucky me! DIM got me under her umbrella
and nurtured me to be the person I am today.

The four years I spent at DIM were one hell of a roller coaster ride. From start to finish, it was all a learning experience
for me. The academic staff, non-academic staff, seniors, and juniors were the perfect brand for ourselves.

DIM was full of happy moments. We had a variety of functions for all levels of study. Regardless of seniority, everyone
enjoyed them to the fullest while tightening the bond between each other. Even today, we often interact with our seniors
and juniors, which keeps the IM family alive.

I work in the ERP industry as a Systems Consultant. As a part of my role, I have to understand the manufacturing
processes, optimize them and at the same time interact with ERP systems to facilitate the business processes. I still
wonder how I would have managed this role if it were not for the modules offered to me in this degree program. I
can vouch for anyone who is willing to take part in this program; this is one of the best places to get industry-ready
knowledge and experiences that will guarantee a place in getting your dream job.

This request is for the youngsters joining DIM. University is not just a place to learn academics, but also a place to
explore life. After admitting to this program, try doing extra-curricular work as much as possible while completing the
academics. The staff will always be there to support you by any means necessary. Get the most out use of the resources
provided by this beautiful place and use them for the betterment of the people who pay for your free education. That
is what the DIM wishes for and what it stands for. Long live the DIM!
