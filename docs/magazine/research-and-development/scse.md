# International Research Conference On Smart Computing & System Engineering 2022

The international research conference on Smart Computing and
Systems Engineering (SCSE) was held for the fifth consecutive time
on the 1st of October 2022. The Department of Industrial Management
collaborated with the IEEE Sri Lanka Section, the Information and
Communication Technology Agency of Sri Lanka (ICTA), and
SLASSCOM as technical sponsors to forge an international forum in
the areas of smart computing and systems engineering.

Prof. Vojtěch Merunka an associate professor in Information
Management at the Faculty of Economics and Management, Czech
University of Life Sciences, and Dr. Nageswaran Kumaresan, vice
president at London Metal Exchange (LME) delivered the keynote
speeches. Professor Nilanthi de Silva, Vice Chancellor of the University
of Kelaniya, graced the occasion as the chief guest.

Though the papers were presented virtually, the conference’s forum
fostered the exploration of cutting-edge technologies among the
interest groups, industry experts, and other delegates who attended.
For further reference, all papers published in SCSE 2022 are available
in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library.
