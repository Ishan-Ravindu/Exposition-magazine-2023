story.
:::

## In your own words, what makes Peter D’Almeida the person he is today?

I would prefer if others described who I am, but if you ask
me what makes me who I am today, I will say that firstly, I am
very thankful that I am socially conscious and concerned about
the betterment of society. I am also happy that I have retained a
sense of humility with all that has gone on in my life. I feel that if I
am humble, I can learn more; than if I think of myself as a know-it-all. I am very thankful that I could retain a sense of humility.

The other is that I have a sense of purpose, which helps
me stay focused. Even today, my sense of purpose is to do
something to pull the country out of the current crisis.

Also, I think I can connect with people of different ages. I can
talk to young children and people much older than me, and those
of different genders. I’m happy that I’m able to connect.

But the things that I’m working on and can improve on, are
being more mindful and calmer. And I think I have to learn to let
go even more. I have let go a lot, but I can let go a lot more.

Finally, I am happy that I can still love people, things, and
nature. I can love more than hate, which is a blessing. And I’m
thankful for where I am today.

## How did your childhood and upbringing influence you both in terms of career and personality? And was there any particular incident that acted as a turning point?

I think people might misunderstand when I say this, but I’ll
explain why I say what I am saying; I think the turning point,
although I didn’t know it then, was when my father passed
away when I was four years old, which completely changed our lives. We were a big family and had no income. I learned a few
important lessons from that.

One is that we have to manage with limited resources. When
you grow up with limited resources, you become sharper about
the value of resources.

Secondly, we learned that people must come together to
keep a family or a community going. My elder brothers and
sisters had to forego their educational aspirations and go for
work to maintain the family. When I first went to work, my salary
came in an envelope - Rs.465. I was a bank clerk. We used to
combine all our money and give it to our mother. The next day,
we get the bus fare and the lunch money. Pooling your resources
for the common good of the family and community is something
I learned very quickly.

But most importantly, a result of losing my father was that I
developed a very open mind. He was a conservative Catholic.
He had very rigid views about what was and was not good. He
would have conditioned me, and I would have become very
narrow in my thinking. I became open-minded because he was
not there, and because my mother was too busy running the
family to interfere with my thinking. For those reasons - and don’t
misunderstand when I say this- my father passing away was a
turning point in my life. Otherwise, I would not have been as free
or as open-minded as I am today.

## Looking back, what was one incident that made a pivotal point in your career?

A pivotal moment in what led to the qualities that I have to
be successful in my career came when at 15 years, I met thisveteran trade unionist, Marxist, socialist, and humanist Bala
Tampoe. He was so well-read: from Marx to Casanova. I got
exposed to Marxism, socialism, the history of revolutions,
psychology, and philosophy. At 15 years, exposure to that kind
of unique experience and vast knowledge made me who I am.

If I have to define a pivotal moment, it was me meeting him
and absorbing all that he had to offer. And I think I would be
half the man I am today if I did not have the encounter with Bala
Tampoe and picked up all these qualities that led to where I am
today, both in my career and personal life.

## You have worked at many institutions over the years. How have those experiences influenced you during the start of N\*able?

One thing I learned is that in any situation, look for
opportunities. People ask me about challenges, and I do not want
to sound arrogant; it is not like there have been no challenges,
but I trained myself to look for opportunities in every challenge.
That is what I brought to N\*able. We started with 12 people and
were up against a few large and well established IT companies,
including MillenniumIT, from which I came. People said we would
not last six months, but our team said, “No, we can.“ Because we
saw new and exciting opportunities that we could go after.

Also, over the years, I have learned how to pull together a team
of people and how to convince them that there is a purpose and
a plan. I learned how to tell them a story and bring them together.
I learned how to lead them by helping them lead themselves.

I think those two qualities of looking for opportunities and
pulling together a team are what I brought to N*able. Because
this is not about you, it’s about your team. You are only as good as
your team. To put together a team and let them grow, not spoon feed them or micromanage them, but give them a chance to look
at the opportunities and then support them. I think those are the
essential things I picked up as I started and grew N*able into a
successful company

## What challenges did you encounter on your path to an executive role? How did you overcome those challenges?

I never set out to become an executive; I did not have that in
my head. But I think of all my roles as forms of leadership, even
when I was a clerk at State Bank. I always wanted to lead myself.
I did not depend on managers, as a result, whatever job I did, I
found that I was leading myself and somehow leading others. I
did not face any challenges as such.

It’s just that I would take on or assume a leadership position
in any role I was in. And when I say leadership, it is about leading
myself and then being able to step up and lead others. I did not
wait for someone to tell me or offer me a hierarchical position.

## You are renowned for your roles in the Sri Lankan media and entertainment industry. In which ways has that industry molded who you are as a person?

I am not sure whether the industry has molded me as such.
But what I draw from being in that world is storytelling.

Storytelling is crucial. To form a company, I have to tell a
story. To hire people, I have to tell a story. I have to tell a story to
our customers and our partners. When you are acting, you are
telling a story. You are playing a character and communicating.
This is what I find common in my limited acting career and my
professional and personal lives.

Most importantly, when you do a film, for example, you are
perpetually reloading. I can look back critically on what I have
done. I can always rewind and wonder whether it was good. Even
in this last television series I did, Koombiyo, although my role
was widely lauded, I can go back, look at it, learn from it and see
what I could have done better. There’s also audience feedback.
Learning to be self-critical and not to sit back on your laurels,
even though others may have thought that you were very good
or excellent, I can see how I could have done it better. That’s an
important quality I learned from being in that industry.

## In your opinion, what skills do prospective employees lack that are most sought by employers?

Some years ago, PricewaterhouseCooper did a study. They
interviewed 3000 CEOs across the world. And they came up
with what they identified as pivotal talents: creativity, problemsolving, collaboration, and communication. But underlying all
this is curiosity. If you are deeply curious, there is nothing that
you cannot discover.

One of the problems we are having is that people cannot
solve problems. Once, at N\*able we wanted to hire people for
our predictive analytics practice. We interviewed three students
who topped their batch at the university in statistics. Sadly, we
could not hire any one of them. They knew their subject but
simply couldn’t apply their learning to solve problems: You give
them a problem and ask them to use regression, they will use it
well. But they cannot look at a challenge and think, “You know
what, I could apply regression to address this problem.” That is
what we found lacking. Our education system does not allow you
to solve problems because, to solve problems, we have to fail. In
our system, failure means match over, and this is the problem.
If you get five answers right, out of ten correct, the student
who got five is not celebrated. No one says, “Oh my God… we
gave you ten problems, you solved five, let’s solve another five.”
We cannot promote problem-solving and curiosity when our
education system is not geared to encourage them. Our system
is entirely based on memorizing and reproducing. This does not
encourage problem-solving.

Further, it does not encourage collaboration either. Students
are made to work alone. Today in the working environment, you
can’t shine as a star by yourself. Individual stars can sometimes
be toxic. You would be great alone, but if you can’t collaborate,
we will be reluctant to keep you on our team. We want people
who can work together.

These are the qualities that we find important. But above all,
curiosity. With the internet, if you are curious, the whole world is
open to you.

## As an established businessman, what words of advice would you like to give budding entrepreneurs to ensure they are on the right track?

Entrepreneurs must be very clear about the business they are
trying to create. They must have a well-defined purpose. They
must be driven by that purpose. In other words, you should be
able to say, “I am either solving this problem or I am creating this
new experience.” I have learned from my early days in marketing
that people buy only one of two things. They buy solutions to
problems or they buy good feelings.

You buy a pen to write, but you buy a Montblanc or a Parker
because you want that experience. An entrepreneur should be
very clear: I am going to offer a new, a cheaper or a better solution,
or else I am going to create a new and exciting experience.

The second important thing I have learned, and am still
learning, and something I could have done better, is to have clear
measurements of success. You have a purpose, you know what
you are going to build, but you must have clear measurements of
how you are progressing. I think very few hopeful entrepreneurs
define what those moments are. Most people use profits as the
measurement, but I say no. Look at the steps along the way.
Profits are just an outcome. When Google set out, they did not
say they wanted an algorithm that would take 10 milliseconds,
they said they wanted it instantaneously. So, they pushed
themselves to answer instantaneously. To get there, they had
very specific measurements. I think that is what people are
lacking. To be successful in building any business, you must be
able to see opportunities in any situation. Spotting opportunities
is what makes a great entrepreneur. Finally, nothing tops hard
work. You must work very hard to get there.

## You value creativity, curiosity, and critical thinking. Do you have any suggestions to develop these traits in an entrepreneur?

This has been a problem, and I have often thought about
whether you can teach people how to be creative and naturally
curious. To be honest, I am not too sure. As a child, you are very
curious and have so many questions, and you are told not to
be too smart! Adults put so many restrictive layers on children
that I sometimes wonder whether you can unravel these layers
and get back to where you were as a child, naturally curious and
creative. But perhaps we can try. Let me give you an example.
Recently, I went to a less-privileged school in Maawala attended
by very poor children. Some university alumni have put up a
fund to provide them with one meal a day. And they cook in the
school. I got the Grade 6 class. I spoke to them for a little while.
I told them my childhood stories. Then I asked them to work in
groups to come up with one challenge they could overcome or
something they recognized the school could do better. After
a while of discussing, they came up with so many ideas. The
principal was shocked. The school or their parents have never
told them to think of ideas and problems. That is what happens
in the university system too. All the lecturers and academia tell
you what to do, instead of letting you develop the curriculum. I
think when we put people into groups and ask them to come up
with ideas, they will. Without supervision, grading, and marks, I
am sure they will come up with ideas. They will pull things from
their past creativity and come up with alternatives, ideas, and
possibilities, which is what creativity is all about. I think there is
hope.

## From your perspective, what should Sri Lanka prioritize to bring more foreign currency into the country?

Sri Lanka’s problem today is not simply about bringing
in foreign revenue. We are losing people as we speak. Do not
forget that we are bankrupt. No money to pay debts, borrow
or generate. We are losing hundreds of thousands of our best
resources. When you are bankrupt, you require good resources
to build back. As long as we have this type of corrupt system
of government, and if we are indifferent, nothing will change.
People will not come back. Why would they, as long as the
leaders who brought the country to bankruptcy are still in
power? The IT industry can help generate foreign currency but
we are rapidly losing people. A group of IT professionals has
come together to address this and some of the larger problems
faced by people. We recognize that what we need is a system
change. If we can make some fundamental changes, then we
create the environment for people to stay and do what they are
best at doing. Then the foreign revenue will come.

## If you could write down a recipe for success, what would it be?

How do you define success? That is the point.I think too many
people are looking at success as material success like money, or
having a home or a car. Fresh graduates out of university think
they should get a job with a high salary, and within two years
they should get a car. They get into debts and loans to build a
house. Some even get into debt just to have a grand wedding
reception. If you define success with that kind of criteria, then I
have no recipe for success.

If you define success as an accomplishment of a purpose or
an aim, then it differs. There’s no recipe for success if you have
not identified what success means to you. Today for me, for
example, success will be if I can mobilize people to resolve some
of the many problems we face. This is what I am doing with the IT
professionals in the country. In this instance, we define success
as achieving some of our specific and measurable tasks around
a few well-defined objectives. I think people should define what
they see as success and they have to write their own recipes.
That is not something to be prescribed. Identify a purpose or
an aim and determine what it looks like if you reach that aim or
purpose; then you can go back and write your recipe. You learn
the recipe yourself. You try, learn, and fail. Perseverance is the
only recipe for success. You cannot give up. Be resilient; fall and
rise. Relentlessly pursue your purpose or your aim.
