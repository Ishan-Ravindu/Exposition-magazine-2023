## How did your upbringing and formative years influence who you are today?

It all goes back to my school and
college days, where the exposure
and motivation, both from my
parents and my school, taught me to
be independent and perseverant at a
young age. I played sports and even
captained some of our school teams.
Also, the belief that ‘knowledge is
very important’ was inculcated in me
at the time. It was those early days
that made me who I am today, and I
would like to thank my parents and
my school St. Thomas’ College, Mt.
Lavinia for molding me into a “total
personality.”

## How has the volunteer work you were involved in at Red Cross led you down your current path?

While I was reading for my
degree, the Tsunami struck Sri
Lanka. I noticed the need to support
the people affected by the tragedy.
The Red Cross was doing a lot of
projects related to construction,
healthcare, education, water, and
sanitary care. I got the opportunity
to volunteer with them. That made
me understand the vulnerabilities of
our fellow citizens. Red Cross gave
me a way to give back to the country
and encouraged me to stay in Sri
Lanka. Initially, I did not have the
financial capability to support those
in need but through Red Cross, I
was able to join in on projects and
achieve self-satisfaction that I am
doing something for our community.

## What compelled you to start a firm specializing in marketing and then later focus on furniture, when you began your undergraduate journey in Information Technology?

My first degree was in Information
Technology. But after a couple of
years, I realized that I am better
at PR and sales. So, I did my CRM
certification and continued my
studies in marketing.
While studying, I wanted to get
some work experience, so I started
off with Red Cross. There, my role
was associated with communication
and project management. Afterward,
I joined an online marketing company.
Today, marketing and technology
go hand in hand. But around 10
to 15 years back, these were two
different subjects. In 2010, I noticed
an opportunity in the industry for a
newcomer in the digital marketing
and technology solutions provider
domain. The background I got from
learning IT helped me immensely
to master the technological part of
marketing and make a name in the
industry.

## Could you explain what “FINEZ” is, and why you started it?

My father was in the furniture
industry. And having seen the works
at a young age, I thought of venturing
into the field. So, we opened a new
factory called “FINEZ” in 2015. There
was also a boom in construction at
the time, and I noticed the demand
for furniture. Instead of going the
conventional route, our business
model prioritized quality, design, and
delivery. We wanted to differentiate
ourselves from the other players
in the market. Now we are more of
a home decor retail brand, offering
other products and solutions in
addition to furniture.

## Since the beginning, how have your priorities evolved?

Those in their 20s often get
pressured to do a degree, find a
job, get married, build a house, and
so on. Youth should get a chance
to pick their path. What you have experienced during your 20s enables
you to apply what you have learned
and make better decisions when you
are in your 30s or 40s.
I took a bold step in my 20s to
venture into entrepreneurship when
people were not too open to the
concept. With experience, ups, and
downs, my priorities have evolved
from establishing a business to
sharing knowledge and experiences,
guiding and motivating the younger
generation to learn from their
mistakes, be courageous and do
what they like.

## What were the obstructions along the way, and how did you overcome them?

There are two obstacles I have
identified. First is the obstacle
created by my own mental barriers.
Feeling demotivated and stressed
is tough. There are days you might
feel discouraged. It is necessary to
talk with someone, especially with
people who have already done what
you are doing, and learn from them.
Next are the environmental
factors-political, economical, social
factors that could affect a person.
Even in the last couple of years, there
was COVID, and a lot of businesses
went through the pressure of how
to pay their team and keep the
business functioning. That is where
it is important to diversify or be
innovative. My experience is, if a
business can innovate ahead of the
market changes, they are always
able to stay ahead of the curve.

## You are more than just an entrepreneur. You are a social activist, an athlete, and a consultant. How do you structure your life to manage all of these activities?

People need to recognize the
importance of nurturing both their
mind and body. If you want to see a
change in your body, mind, or career,
you need to act now so you can see
the results after a year. These should
be taught. Self-care is important.
There is a saying that some people
die in their 20s and get buried in their
70s. You should not let this happen.
Just make an effort, even the little
things like dressing smart can go a
long way. Then comes the learning
part. You should seek knowledge, to
not only get a job but to become a
better person. The more you read,
and the more you learn, the more
balanced you become. Another thing
is to discourage negativity because
it is through positivity and optimism
that you always try to find a way.
Once you nurture yourself, then only
you can give back to the community.
One should always try to give their
best version at all times, irrespective
of what happens around them.

## You have amassed many accolades and respect in the industry as a successful entrepreneur. What achievements make you the proudest, and what do you believe is the driving force behind your success?

When I started as an entrepreneur,
I had the freedom to do what I wanted
to do. Being my own boss, the sort
of satisfaction and freedom I felt was
immense. Another achievement was
getting the right type of people and
seeing them succeed in what they
do. When seeing people achieve
things and grow into their roles, I feel
proud. The other satisfaction is like
planting a tree and seeing it come to
fruition. It is not only about making
money. Providing employment,
giving support, and seeing customer
satisfaction, add value to society
and also to the community. Yes,
awards bring recognition and
validity, but more than that, being
a value-adding entrepreneur and
encouraging others to do the same
are my biggest achievements in
terms of myself. If you condition
your mind to be satisfied with those
achievements, you won’t go wrong
as an entrepreneur.

## Everyone understands how difficult it is to start a business. If one wishes to invent a new idea, many risks will be involved. As a result, young people frequently have feelings of self-doubt and fear of failure. How did you handle your anxiety and skepticism when you first started?

For about 5 to 6 years, I worked for corporates. I
wanted freedom, I wanted to get away from that culture,
and it was more towards doing my own thing, and being
my own person. I didn’t have a lot of anxiety in terms of
taking that risk since I wanted to do so. I had some savings
with me and it was enough for me to work on. Initially, it
was only me, but then I hired a couple of designers and
someone to coordinate. Financially we were successful.
But then we moved our office to Colombo and there
were a lot of overheads like traveling costs. So from
around 2014-2015 the “real business process” started.
We were expanding, hiring, so there was a lot of stress
and pressure. It was a learning curve, from starting a
business to registering the company, to opening up the
bank accounts. I had to learn the hard way, with no one
to guide me through the process. So if someone wants
to start as an entrepreneur, I would suggest getting a
mentor. At the same time, it is important to develop a
mindset, to not give up, and to learn from failures without
being afraid to make mistakes.

## As a consultant, what insights would you share with entrepreneurs looking to break into the field?

Entrepreneurship is about finding opportunities
and solutions to solve problems. In the current market
dynamics, the available opportunities and solutions
that can be given, change very fast. It is important to
understand that because what trends today, might
be forgotten next year. Also, after finishing school or
graduating, you have sound knowledge in certain areas.
It is easier to venture through those areas as you have
a better understanding of that field. If you want to do
something completely different from what you have
studied, then it’s important to put forward your skills
and knowledge. Entrepreneurship revolves around
dealing with people and finding solutions, selling them
to people, understanding their psychology, and why
they would buy your product or service. You have to be
creative and innovative. And in this day and age, you can
use social media platforms to reach a wider audience.

## In your opinion, what are some business prospects that fresh graduates would find worth exploring?

The main thing is to focus on an area where they
can generate revenue outside of Sri Lanka. Our market
conditions are tough, and it is difficult to enter the
industry, so that is the best option. There is a lot of
opportunity for local products to earn foreign income.
Then there are freelancing platforms where people can
offer their skills at a dollar rate. As long as you have a
computing device and an internet connection, you can
offer these services. So focus on that. These avenues
will guide you to become an entrepreneur. What you
need to do is start from somewhere and grow through it.
