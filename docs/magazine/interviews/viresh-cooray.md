## What was the inspiration behind Daddy?

We started because we wanted to make music and
nothing else.

We were all just out of school and wanted to form a
band. I was at APIIT, and Gayan also joined APIIT. There,
both of us were asked to play at a concert. At that
time, Gayan had already started a band called “Jada”.
So I performed with them, and when one of their band
members left, I was asked to be a part of it. So, I joined
the band, and we changed the name to Daddy. That’s
how we started. What made us start the band was a
love for music. We just wanted to play. We never had big
plans.

For about a year and a half, we played at nightclubs
and small functions. It wasn’t much, but for us, the
passion for playing live is more significant than anything
else. Greater than seeing ourselves on TV or hearing
ourselves on the radio. The passion for just going out
and playing live to an audience is much greater, even
today. That was the inspiration behind Daddy.

## What was the turning point for Daddy?

For the band, I think it was the song “Massina”. That
was our first-ever original. We got lucky that our first
song did quite well in Sri Lanka. Usually, some bands and
artists release about five or six songs before people start
liking them. We got lucky, and our first release, “Massina”,
was reasonably well received. Around the same time, we
released the album, also called “Massina”. It had songs
like “Borukaari”, “Ai kale”, “SMS”, and “Chandrayan pidu”
in it. All of these songs became hits. So I think we got
lucky with that. That’s when we realized that people
might, sort of, like us.

When we released it, we never assumed anyone would
like it. We just wanted to make some songs and put them
out. We wanted to establish our identity in the world. We
wanted to make a name for ourselves in the industry, but
as I previously stated, it was simply a matter of putting
something out and being able to play concerts and such.

## What was the biggest hurdle Daddy faced? How did you overcome it?

We had hurdles because we’ve
been together for around 18 years
now. The biggest hurdle was when
Gayan, our frontman, left the band.
A lot of people associated Gayan
with Daddy, and all of a sudden, that
changed. It took us a while to make
people understand that Daddy was
an entire unit. And it wasn’t made
up of just one person or two people.
The sound came from everyone in the group, and one
or two people going missing wouldn’t change the sound
drastically. That took us a while. That was one of the
biggest hurdles we had to pass because after Gayan
left the band, we had to play quite a few concerts for
people to understand that the music was still the same,
the energy was still the same, and the output was still
Daddy. But I think we managed to do that.

We didn’t have a business plan in place to deal with it.
All we knew was that we had to keep playing music, and
we did that. We released a few songs, and we had a few
more coming. But I think those few songs did the trick.

## How has the journey been so far in becoming a recognized artist?

Journey-wise, it’s honestly been amazing for people
to know your music and for people to know you as a
band. It definitely makes life a lot more interesting. But
our initial goal was just to be able to play music. And
I think people knowing us is just the byproduct of us
playing our music. That was it. We enjoy the fact that
people know our music and come to our concerts. That
is a big plus And yes, our livelihood depends on our fan base. We
have been a part of the band for so long because of the
people who listen to our music, and we are grateful for
that. But I think the feeling of being able to play as a
band as opposed to being known anywhere is what we
aim for. Our goal is to play until we die, until we can’t
play anymore. Our main goal is to simply play our music.
We are all musicians, and our biggest passion is playing
our instrument, singing, or just being up on stage and
performing for people. I think that is pretty much the
highlight of our career, too.

## You have won many accolades over the years. Which award was the most memorable?

I think our first few awards. We won six awards at
the Derana Music Video Awards for the song “Massina”.
Those were the most memorable because it was our
first time winning anything that big. We had won some
amateur awards and stuff like that, but this was on
national TV, and it was a huge deal for us. It helped with
publicity too. So the most memorable awards were the
six we won at the Derana MV Awards.

## In what ways has teamwork contributed to the band’s success?

If you’re part of a unit, teamwork is the only way you
will get through anything. One person cannot, in any way,
handle all of the stress and whatever issues are thrown
our way. So, in our band, we usually delegate things to
different people. Someone manages the financial aspect,
another the social media aspect, the band practices,
and so on. You cannot sustain a unit without teamwork.
Everyone must share the same goal.

There have been times when people have lost focus
and have become involved in other aspects of their lives.
But when you have one goal, it makes life easier. I don’t
think anything can work without teamwork. Even if you
are a solo artist, you have a team to help you manage
everything.

Since we were a team, we never had to go outside the
band for anything. If we needed to record a song, all the
instruments were played by the band, and most of the
melodies and most of the songs were made by the band.

Some of the lyrics were written by our friends
Lahiru Perera, who is almost a band member, Sanuka,
Manuranga, and a few others. Lahiru was heavily
involved in making the album “Massina”, and we were
heavily involved in making “Rambari”. Except for those
few people, we never had to go outside for anything.
That saved us a lot of trouble because we do everything
internally. So that’s one of the biggest things about
being part of a team.

## How was it like preparing for “Aaley”?

It was the biggest concert series we had done, and
preparing for the first concert was nerve-wracking. All
of our song arrangements were different. We practiced
almost daily for almost two months, more than 12 hours a
day, to play that concert without any issues. We wanted
to do something different from the songs you hear on the
radio. We made a lot of changes, and that helped keep
the songs alive. Those songs have been well received.

Aside from when we didn’t have work or meetings,
it was a lot of fun. Because I think what a lot of people
don’t understand is that when you’re playing a concert,
it’s supposed to look easy to the audience. It’s supposed
to look like we’re just coming up and performing. But
we have to practice to the point where we don’t have
to think about what we’re doing. So it’s assimilating
everything you’re doing into muscle memory. That takes
time. So we practiced quite a lot. It was fun. It was also
quite stressful. We had some amazing musicians in the
audience, and it was nerve-wracking playing for them.
But, yeah, it worked out well.

## How did Daddy survive the aftermath of the pandemic and, later, the economic crisis?

We had a bit of an income from social media; YouTube,
Spotify, and all of that. There were no concerts, and all of
us had to stay home. All musicians earned zero income,
but we had savings to get us through the two years.

And after that, once work started, there was an
economic crisis. The prices in Sri Lanka have gone up. So
accordingly, to align ourselves with that, we had to bring
our ticket prices up, but it’s been okay. I think people are
going through a lot of things right now. Financially, it’s
quite tough for people in Sri Lanka. But I think you have
to get on with life. There is not a lot you can do aside
from being positive and working on yourself. So that’s
what we’ve been doing.

You can sit and complain, but I believe in attracting
good thoughts. I believe that thinking positive thoughts
attracts positive things into your life. So we don’t believe
in sitting and complaining about what we don’t have.
Whatever is there, we make the most of it. We chose to
look at the bright side.

We are managing. We’re doing quite well financially. I
guess we’ll have to see how things go in the country. But
I think if you are financially smart, you should be able to
manage. And I hope things get better for people in Sri
Lanka because they’re honestly going through quite a
lot. It’s not easy, but how we manage is by looking at the
bright side of things and focusing on what we can do as
opposed to what we can’t.

## What are your aspirations as a group?

We want to have a song or two or an album that will
eventually be internationally recognized. That is the
plan. We have some things in the works. Actually, we
have a collaboration with a British singer coming up, not
quite soon, but we are in the midst of preparing for it.

In the Sri Lankan market, we want to get our new songs
out. We wrote around 20 songs during the pandemic.
We have all of them coming out very soon. Five singles
will be released this year.

But the end goal is to live a comfortable life doing
what we love, playing some concerts, and entertaining
the audience. The ultimate goal is to have a few hits
outside the country. We are slowly working on it. Not as
actively as we would like, but we are working on it.

## Do you have any words of advice for young artists looking to make a name for themselves in the industry?

The best advice I can give is, and I know this is a big
cliche, you have to believe in yourself. A lot of Sri Lankans
have been conditioned to think small since birth. We are
told “angille tharamata idimenna” and all that. I think all
of that is nonsense. I do not agree with that. I think if you
have a passion for something, regardless of what people
around you tell you to do, do it! I had a passion for music,
and I pursued that path. Everyone in the band, I believe,
did the same thing.

Understand who you are. That is important. Be
unique, because that is what will make people like you.
The world needs someone new, someone unique, not
another Michael Jackson or another Rookantha.

Believe in what you want to do and go for it. I
personally don’t believe in a plan B. Have a plan A and
work really hard for it. Hard work does not mean killing
yourself day in and day out. It is about working hard and
working smart. Research your subject on the internet
and YouTube. Using these, it is easy to figure out what
to do in terms of marketing yourself.

My advice for people who want to start now is to
believe in who they are, figure out who they want to be,
and do exactly that.
