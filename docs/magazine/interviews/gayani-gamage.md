## You hold bachelor’s and master’s degrees in two different disciplines (BSc. MIT & MBA). How has this helped you climb up the career ladder?

When I signed up for the MBA, it
was not really two different disciplines
because I had a really good foundation
from MIT on the management side of it.
Because I started my MBA soon after
getting out of university, and MIT was a
really good foundation for me and helped
me get the MBA done as well.

I bought into management early in
my career. After one year of graduation,
I began working as a junior project
manager, and I was always the youngest
of the group of managers in meetings. So
having the MBA often helped to provide
credibility in addition to “Yes, I have the
skill, the ability, and the capabilities”. And
also having the mix of management and
IT really helped. Because you often end
up talking to CXO levels, you have to know
what they’re talking about and show that
you belong in that boardroom. In that
sense, having both the MIT degree and an
MBA really helped me. When you are in a
management role in a company, there are
some places where you need to chip in to
help get out of some situations, and that
is where your education in management
or business administration which helps in
the career aspect as well. And that makes
you shine in unexpected places. So I
believe that’s where MIT and both MBA
sort of helped me get to where I am today in my career.

## You have maintained your GPA at 4.0 while being on the hockey team,vice-captain in basketball, and in AIESEC. How did you balance these at the same time?

To be honest, at that time, I don’t think
I knew what I was doing or had any kind
of formula or mantra to balance. But now
that I’m looking back at it, I know that
it definitely balanced them out. I am a
person who loves mingling with people
and also has a personality that draws
energy from the interactions that I have.
Also sports, again it’s a lot of interactions
and that helps lower stress. I made some
good friends on the basketball team,
and we’re still in touch. Being the hockey
goalkeeper taught me how to deal with
failure. Another aspect of this is that I also
had to show my mom that I made the
right decision by pursuing MIT because
she wanted me to become a doctor. So
probably that motivated me in getting the
academics done. And for academics, we
had really good “kuppi” sessions at the
end of the semester, and we worked well
together and helped each other figure
things out. And, as I previously stated,
I don’t have a perfect answer, such as,
“Okay, yeah, this is what matters, so I
knew how to do this, and this is how I did
it.” I don’t have such an answer. But glad I
was able to do all that which helped make
me who I am today.

## What makes you stay motivated?

I don’t have a nice answer, because
believe it or not, I’m kind of a lazy
person. So for me, it’s always like, “What
is the easiest way to get this done?” I
procrastinate a lot, which is kind of a bad
habit of mine, but my self-belief and the
knowing that I can do it and that , at the
end, gives me a sense of achievement.
And also figuring out, the easiest way to
do something, and if I can achieve in my
way of doing it, then that gives me more
“Oh yes, I figured out how to put in the
least amount of time and effort.” I think
that’s what motivates me.

## How did you deal with challenging times? What do you consider was the biggest sacrifice you made to get where you are now?

I don’t think I had to make big
sacrifices. I would say it was a bunch of
little things that I had to do. When I moved
to Singapore, I had a really good job going
on and a promotion lined up, but my
priorities were obviously my life, my family,
and my happiness. So I had to sort of
sacrifice my career at that point to come
to a country where there was no promised
job opportunity. That choice was difficult
at the time, but it has shaped who I am
today. And I learned a lot, faced different
challenges, and all of that has made me
into a person I would not have become
if I stayed on the same course that I was
on in Sri Lanka. I wouldn’t call it a big
sacrifice, but tiny sacrifices like going for
a workout without spending time with my
family or sometimes working a little late
are some of the sacrifices. But to answer
your question about the biggest sacrifice,
I don’t have any such thing.

And, in terms of dealing with difficult
situations, I believe I’ve gotten better
over time. Back then, I’d probably stick
to talking with friends and my mom, but
now I think it’s more about perspective,
like asking why I’m doing this or why I’m
in this situation. I just sit back and look
at the bigger picture to see where I am
going and realize that maybe I’m worrying
for no reason, so I should probably stop.
And sometimes, if I fail at something, I just
move on. That’s kind of how I deal with
challenging times.

## What made you choose the current sector you are employed in as a career path?

It wasn’t easy. I was really struggling
with the decision of which job to go to.
I also got selected for a special degree
at the time, and I even went to a couple
of lectures. Then I realized what is best
for me at the time is not pursuing it, and
then I got a job as a software engineer.
That makes no sense now, given where
I am in life and career, but at the time, I
believe it was part of what drew me to
the job, so I took it. Then I was introduced
to agile in the company, and I realized
this is something for which I am actually
more suitable. Also, I’m fortunate to have
some managers and mentors inside the
company and outside who helped me
realize this is where I shine. Then I moved
on as a junior PM, and after that, I think
I’ve never looked back. It was more of a
pick-and-choose, and then on the job I
realized I was better at this.

## You have been in the industry for around 10 years. What advice would you give to a beginner in the industry or a fresh graduate?

That’s actually a good question. At
the time, I had good mentors and some
people that I could talk to. What they
said, and what I’m going to say, is to keep
your eyes open.
Like I said, I moved
my career from
software engineer
to PM within just
one year, just
because I knew
that I was better at
this. So keep your
eyes open and
don’t limit yourself.
You might have to
go into industry in
one position, and
because these are
difficult times, you
may have to change or get a new job as
soon as possible. The times are not really
easy for us to be picky, I guess. So just go in
and then try to navigate within the system
is one of the things. Other than that, invest
in friendships, learn by yourself, don’t limit
yourself just to a degree, read a lot, and
learn a lot. Learn to forgive yourself and
move on.

## Being in the industry, you may have received several opportunities. How do you decide whether to take or ignore the opportunities?

I think taking or ignoring opportunities
changes over time as well. For example,
when I just moved to Singapore, I was
looking for opportunities. So I was not very
picky on what I am gonna get. At the level
I am now, I get different opportunities.
Happiness and balance are priorities
for me. Work-life balance and stability
are two things that I look for. It actually
depends on the phase where your life is
at. It’s worth it if you can spend a little bit
of time to understand what you really want
to do, and try to switch sides and prepare
as if you are interviewing the opportunity/
company, that mindset change will help
you get to better places.

## You have worked for a few companies in Sri Lanka as well as in Singapore. What do you have to say about the working environment in both countries?

I was actually one of those lucky people who worked for some of the great
companies in Sri Lanka, and they’re
doing well now. One of the biggest
differences I see is the work-life balance.
It’s not that we’re doing less work here,
but in comparison, in Singapore, the
work portion is higher than in Sri Lanka.
Technically, I would say that all the
companies that I work with here are more
focused on cyber security, and I don’t
think that’s something that I’ve seen in
Sri Lanka. The balance and perspective
are really different here compared to Sri
Lanka. Also, the overall quality of life and
focus on health and fitness, even at the
workplace, are really high here. Many
working people here are more concerned
about health and aware of their health
as compared to Sri Lanka. Singaporean
workplaces really care about your mental
health. If you feel stressed, you can take
a mental health day off. I believe that
the opportunity or awareness to do so is
important, and I believe that it has now
probably evolved to Sri Lanka as well.
